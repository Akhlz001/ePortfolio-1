Skill No 1

<h2>General</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">I have been a full time teacher for over 40 years, and that involves delivering lessons at scheduled times, and within specific time frames.&nbsp; I had to ensure that all the appropriate knowledge and skills were delivered prior to fixed assessment dates, even if I was not that familiar with the learning outcomes.&nbsp; So at times that involved organising my own learning experiences so that I was able to deliver the appropriate content</span></p>
